# Introduction

Plotters is a drawing library aimed to expedite the production of high-quality data visualization in Rust.

Plotters supports various types of backend and provides a easy-to-use high level drawing API that
makes data visualization easy. The Plotters API is designed to be highly flexible and extensible.

Plotters is able to render the data visualization as a static image, a GIF animation and even realtime rendering
backed on WASM, Piston Window or GTK/Cario.
